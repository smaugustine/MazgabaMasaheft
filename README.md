# Mazgaba Maṣāḥǝft

**Mazgaba Maṣāḥǝft** is a slimmed-down web app for viewing data from the [Beta Maṣāḥǝft project](https://github.com/BetaMasaheft). It is not intended as a replacement for the regular app, but rather as an alternative way to view the project data. Where the regular app excels as a comprehensive research environment, this app merely provides a convenient way to access the basic information directly from the source.

## How it works

Since the project data is stored as XML files in GitHub repositories, we can use GitHub's API to access those files directly. While this is much quicker than using the project database, it also means sacrificing a number of features.
